## Determine the Active vCPU Distribution Template

To determine which template is being used for vCPU distribution, use the following command:
```show platform software cpu alloc```

Example:

```
Router#show platform software cpu alloc
CPU alloc information:
  Control plane cpu alloc: 0
  Data plane cpu alloc: 1
  Service plane cpu alloc: 0
  Template used: None
Router#
```

The Control plane and the Service plane share cores 0.

## Adding Bootstrap File to the flash (Option)

If you did not provide the Bootstrap Config as iso file (mounted as CDROM) during the VM creation, you can still copy the bootstrap file into the file and reset the router to start from scratch. If there is no config in NVRAM, then the SD-WAN router will search bootflash: or usbflash: for filename ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg

Copy the bootstrap file generated by vManage or created using Linux tools into the router bootflash â€“ Make sure you use the exact name: ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg

```
Router#copy scp: bootflash:
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.1.107
Source username [admin]? jmb
Source filename []? CSR-cloudinit-KVM.txt
Destination filename [CSR-cloudinit-KVM.txt]? ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg
Password:
 Sending file modes: C0644 7569 CSR-cloudinit-KVM.txt
!
7569 bytes copied in 9.024 secs (839 bytes/sec)
Router#
```

Reset the SDWAN software in order for the chassis serial number from the ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg file to be applied to the device.
```request platform software sdwan software reset```

Once the router is back online, login and confirm that the chassis number is the same as the one from the Bootstrap File.
Check handling of ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg file

```
Router#show log process plogd internal | i sdwan|Fail
```
