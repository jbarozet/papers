# Deploying CSR1000v



## Overview

Upon bootup, CSR1000v SD-WAN XE router will search bootflash: or usbflash: for filename ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg (make sure you use the exact same name). This file is the cloud-init file generated by vManage.

In a KVM (or OpenStack) context, CSR1000v/C8000v only supports file-based **config-drive** configuration, which is to say CSR1000v/C8000v does not generally support metadata or user_data as Day0 delivery mechanisms.

So the workflow is to generate the bootstrap config file (from vManage or linux tools), then create an iso image that contains this file. This will be mounted as a cdrom and used by cloud-init to bootstrap de VM.

## Instantiating CSR10000v in Controller Mode

<br>

Deploying CSR1000v in controller mode

```
$ openstack server create --image csr1000v-17.02.01 \
   --flavor flavor_csr \
   --network sdwan-mgmt \
   --network mainnet \
   --network sdwan-mpls \
   --network sdwan-lan-site5 \
   --config-drive true \
   --file day0-config=ciscosdwan_cloud_init.cfg \
   csr5
```

## Basic day0 configuration of CSR1000v

<br>

If CSR1000v is instantiated without any day0 config, you have to create a basic configuration for the router to be able to register to the controllers and then activate the CSR1000v.

**Go to Openstack Console for the VM**

By default, the Unified image will boot in autonomous mode - Enable SD-WAN mode

```
controller-mode enable
```

If it tells you that you do not have a day0 config - that's fine - Answer the questions so you can reboot.

Once rebooted, CSR1000v is now in SD-WAN mode (controller mode) with no config.

Add the minimum configuration so you can ssh to the VM.

Enable dhcp on the interface you want to ssh to - sdwan-mgt (GigabitEthernet1), or any interface - using config-transaction

```
interface GigabitEthernet1
 no shutdown
 ip address dhcp
 negotiation auto
exit

commit
```

Then enable ssh under line vty 0 4

```
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
!

commit
```

<br>

ssh to your CSR1000v and cut/paste the following config - Tunnel number is interface number:

- GigabitEthernet2 => Tunnel2

```
system
 location              Toulouse
 system-ip             10.0.0.201
 site-id               20
 admin-tech-on-failure
 organization-name    <YOUR ORG NAME>
 vbond <YOUR VBOND IP>
!
interface GigabitEthernet2
 no shutdown
 ip address dhcp
 negotiation auto
exit
!
interface Tunnel2
 no shutdown
 ip unnumbered GigabitEthernet2
 tunnel source GigabitEthernet2
 tunnel mode sdwan
Exit
!
sdwan
 interface GigabitEthernet2
  tunnel-interface
   encapsulation ipsec
   color biz-internet
   no allow-service bgp
   allow-service dhcp
   allow-service dns
   allow-service icmp
   allow-service sshd
   no allow-service netconf
   no allow-service ntp
   no allow-service ospf
   no allow-service stun
   allow-service https
   no allow-service snmp
  exit
!
```

## Register CSR1000v to SD-WAN Controllers

 <br>

Go to vManage > Devices

- Select a CSR1000v that is available and generate the bootstrap config - same procedure as for vEdgeCloud.

- Save UUID and OTP.

 SSH to your device, then activate the new UUID:

```
request platform software sdwan vedge_cloud activate chassis-number <UUID> token <OTP>
```

<UUID> and <TOKEN> are the values saved in the step before.
